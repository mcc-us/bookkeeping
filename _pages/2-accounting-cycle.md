## 4. Prepare Worksheet of Trial Balance(s)

- Trial balances do not concern themselves with ALORE.

- Instead, the Trial balance lists all accounts in the journal/ledger with their *normal balances*.

## 5. Make Adjusting Entries (If Needed)

- After incorporating adjustments, a new trial balance is generated,
- This reflects a more accurate picture of the company's financial state at a specific point in time.
