This a simplified flowchart depicting the order of operations for ledgers and journals:

### Start: Transaction occurs in your business.

1. Journalize the Transaction
   1. Use a journal to record the transaction chronologically.
   2. Each entry includes the date, account titles (affected accounts), amounts (debits and credits), and a brief description.
   3. This creates a chronological record of all transactions.

2. Post the Transaction:

   1. Transfer the information from the journal to individual accounts in the ledger.
   2. Each account in the ledger represents a specific asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense.
   3. Update the account balances with the debit/credit amounts from the journal entry.
   4. This distributes the transaction's impact across relevant accounts.

3. (Optional) Prepare a Subsidiary Ledger (if applicable):

   1. For complex accounts with numerous transactions, create a subsidiary ledger for detailed tracking.
   2.   This breaks down the main account in the ledger into subcategories for further analysis.
   3.   Post detailed transactions related to the main account to the subsidiary ledger.

4. Update Trial Balance:

   1. Periodically (e.g., monthly), prepare a trial balance by listing all accounts and their balances from the ledger.
   2. Ensure the total debits equal the total credits, verifying the accuracy of your records.

5. Prepare Financial Statements:

   1. Use the balances from the ledger and trial balance to prepare financial statements like the balance sheet and income statement.
   2. These statements summarize your financial position and performance at a specific point in time.

6. Close Temporary Accounts (optional):

   1. At the end of an accounting period, transfer balances from temporary accounts (revenue, expense) to permanent accounts (retained earnings).
   2. This resets temporary accounts to zero for the next period while reflecting their impact on retained earnings.

7. Archive Records:

   1. Store transaction details in the journals and supporting documents for future reference and auditing.

### Remember:

- Journalizing chronologically records transactions.
- Posting distributes their impact to individual accounts in the ledger.
- Closing entries (optional) prepare for the next period by resetting temporary accounts.
