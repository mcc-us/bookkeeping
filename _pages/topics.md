This is a simplified flowchart depicting the order of operations for ledgers and journals:

Begin: Transaction occurs in your business.

#### 1. Journalize the Transaction  
   1. Record transactions chronologically using journal.  
   2. Each entry NEEDS: **date, account titles (affected accounts), amounts (debits and credits), and a brief description**.  

#### 2. Post the Transaction  

   1. Transfer the transactions from the journal to individual accounts in the ledger.  
   2. Each account in the ledger represents a specific asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense.  
   3. Update account balances with the debit/credit amounts from the journal entry.  
   4. This distributes the transaction's impact to all relevant accounts.  

#### 3. (Optional) Prepare a Subsidiary Ledger (if applicable)  

   1. For complex accounts with numerous transactions, create a subsidiary ledger for detailed tracking.  
   2. This breaks down the main account in the ledger into subcategories for further analysis.  
   3. Post detailed transactions related to the main account to the subsidiary ledger.  

#### 4. Update Trial Balance  

   1. Periodically (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly), prepare a trial balance by listing all accounts and their balances from the ledger.  
   2. Ensure **total debits equal total credits**, to verify the accuracy of your records.  

#### 5. Prepare Financial Statements  

   1. Use the balances from the ledger and trial balance to prepare financial statements.  
   2. Prepare Income statement, Changes in Equity, Balance Sheet.  

#### 6. Close Temporary Accounts (optional)   

   1. At the end of an accounting period, transfer balances from temporary accounts (revenue, expense) to permanent accounts (retained earnings).   
   2. This resets temporary accounts to zero for the next period while reflecting their impact on retained earnings.   

#### 7. Archive Records   

   1. Store transaction details in the journals and supporting documents for future reference and auditing.
