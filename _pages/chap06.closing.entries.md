**4 Steps**    

1. **Debit Revenu**e**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Credit Income Summary**  
2. **Debit Income Summary**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Credit All Expenses**  
3. **Transfer Income Summary (Net Gain or Loss) to the Owner’s Capital**  
4. **Debit Owner’s Capital**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Credit Drawings**  

After the closing entries have been posted, the capital account reflects the results of operations for the period, EITHER A NET GAIN or LOSS.

The revenue and expense accounts (*with zero balances*) are ready to accumulate data for the next period.
