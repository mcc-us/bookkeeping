### 1. Sole Proprietor

- One owner is solely responsible for all debts and taxes.  
- Separate entity assumption - keep company and personal finances separate.  
- When owner dies so does business unless it is sold.  
- Easy to form: **DBA-Doing Business As**  

### 2A. Partnerships

- Partners decide break down of all rights, obligations and limitations in the company beforehand.
  - $ or % initially contributed, % ownership, % or share of profits
  - Duties and responsibilities including to creditors and tax authorities OR Other intangible liabilities
- If one partner is negligent then other is **ON THE HOOK**
- Business is dissolved when the partnership is dissolved.

### 2B. Limited Liability Partnerships

- Partners are only responsible for their own actions.  
- For example, If one partner is negligent(malfeasance) then other is **OFF THE HOOK**  

### 3. Corporations

- Corp has legal right to own property & do business under its own name.  
- Stock is used in place of simple owner's equity  
- Private companies = 'Closely Held'  
- Stockholders are not responsible for the debts of the company.  
- More complex overall to start and run  

### 3B. S-Corps

- Has concept of **"pass-through taxation" & avoids double taxation**.  
- Like a partnership, the corp pays NO income tax.  
- Owner's have limited liability  


Understanding Business Structures for Bookkeepers
--- 


Financial Reporting:

- Helps identify potential risks and compliance issues based on the structure (e.g., sole proprietor vs. LLC) or (e.g., tax rules for S-Corps vs. C-Corps).

Decision-Making & Analysis:

- Financial ratios & metrics might differ based on structure.
- Provides tailored financial advice considering legal and operational aspects.
- Identifies financial strengths and weaknesses unique to each structure.

Client Communication & Service:

- Cater services to specific financial reporting, tax, and compliance needs.
- Explains financial concepts relevant to their structure and challenges.
- Build trust by demonstrating understanding of their business type.

### Importance of Business Types

1. **Sole Proprietorships**: Easy to form, but owners have unlimited liability for business debts.

2. **Partnerships**: Shared ownership and management, with variations like general partnerships (all partners fully liable) and limited partnerships (limited liability for some partners).

3. **Corporations**: Separate legal entity from owners, offering limited liability and potential for raising capital. Consider sub-categories like C-Corps (double taxation) and S-Corps (avoid double taxation).

4. **Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)**: Combine flexibility of a partnership with limited liability protection for owners.

### LLC v. LLP

**Key differences between:**  

- Limited Liability Partnerships Vs. Limited Liability Company  

#### Structure

- LLP: **Partners share profits and losses according to predefined agreements**. They are typically formed by professionals like lawyers, accountants, or doctors.  

- LLC: **Offers more flexibility, allowing for both partnership and corporate-like characteristics**. Members can choose to share profits and losses proportionally or based on specific agreements, similar to an LLP, or elect for fixed shares, like in a corporation.  

#### Liability  

- LLP: **Partners can still be held liable for their own negligence or malpractice.** Partners have limited liability for the partnership's debts and obligations.  

- LLC: **Members enjoy limited liability for the LLC's debts and obligations, regardless of their individual actions** or negligence (except in rare cases of piercing the corporate veil).  

#### Management & Governance

- LLP: **Typically managed by partners** who share decision-making responsibilities. Some states may require specific governance structures, such as managing partners.  

- LLC: **Can be managed by members, managers (appointed by members), or a combination**. LLC operating agreements outline management structure and decision-making processes.  

#### Taxation

- LLP: Profits and losses pass through to partners' individual tax returns, **avoiding double taxation**. LLPs are treated as partnerships for tax purposes.  
- LLC: **LLC can elect corporate taxation status if desired**. Offering flexibility in choosing taxation. By default, LLCs are also taxed as partnerships.  This can be beneficial for larger LLCs or those with substantial profits.  

#### Other Considerations

- Transferability of Ownership:  
  - **LLPs may have restrictions on transferring ownership interests**  
  - **LLCs generally offer more flexibility in transferring membership** interests.  

- Formation and Maintenance:  
  - LLPs may have specific formation and ongoing regulatory requirements depending on the profession or state.  
  - LLCs generally require less paperwork and ongoing formalities.
