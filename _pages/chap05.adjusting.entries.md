title: D-Adjusting Entries
---

- Adjustments or adjusting entries are for previously unrecorded items.     
   - Adjustments recognize when expenses paid in advance, but have yet to be consumed. As time elapses, the asset is used. Because these expenses are bought before use, they are sometimes considered **assets**.  


$$Assets + \frac{Expenses}{\begin{bmatrix}
Prepaid~ Expenses \\
e.g.~ Prepaid~ Insurance \\
e.g.~ Prepaid~ Supplies \\
Accrued~ Expense-Interest \\
\end{bmatrix}} = Liabilities + Equity + \frac{Revenue}{\begin{bmatrix}
Accrued~ Revenue \\
Deferred~ Revenue \\
\end{bmatrix}}$$  


1. Prepaid Expenses - { *Insurance, Rent, Supplies, Advertising* }  
2. ???? Depreciation / Accumulated Depreciation   ?????????  
3. Accrued Expense-Interest   
4. Accrued Revenue   
5. Deferred Revenue

- Common Prepaid expenses are:
  - Pre-paid Rent
  - Pre-paid Insurance
  - Pre-paid Advertising
  - Pre-paid Supplies, etc.
  - For example: Auto insurance is prepaid but **expires** monthly.

- Accrued Revenue represents income earned, but hasn't yet received payment for.   
- Since Accrued Revenue is an asset account representing uncollected revenue, it follows the logic of a revenue account and has a normal credit balance.   

**Accrued Revenue**: you've earned the $5,000 for your consulting services. However, you haven't received the payment yet because of the client's payment terms.

**Accounting Treatment** To reflect the income earned in your financial statements for January, you need to record accrued revenue.   


### 5. Deferred Revenue

**Discussion**

they can vary depending on the business. 

1. *Depreciation Expenses*: This adjustment allocates the cost of an asset over its useful life as an expense. It ensures the asset's cost isn't recognized all at once but gradually spread over time. It benefits the business as the investment is being used.

2. *Accrued Expenses*: These adjustments recognize expenses incurred but not yet paid, resulting in a liability. 

3. *Accrued Revenues*: These adjustments recognize revenue earned but have yet to be recorded because cash has yet to be received. 

4. *Deferred Revenues*: These adjustments recognize cash received in advance for services you still need to provide. For example, suppose you receive a subscription payment in December for January access. In that case, you'd need to defer the revenue in December and record a deferred revenue liability.
