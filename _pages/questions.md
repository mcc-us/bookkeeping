## Q. when using the worksheet balance sheet, the account form balance sheet must be used not the report form balance sheet? True or False

False.

When using the worksheet in QuickBooks Online, you can actually use either the account form balance sheet or the report form balance sheet.

Here's why:

- Account Form Balance Sheet: This provides a detailed listing of each account and its balance. It can be helpful for reviewing individual account activity.

- Report Form Balance Sheet: This offers a more concise overview of your company's financial position, categorized into sections like assets, liabilities, and equity.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your preference and what information you need for the worksheet.

Here are some additional points to consider:

- The worksheet is a tool used to adjust accounts and prepare for closing entries before finalizing financial statements.

- You can access both account form and report form balance sheets in QuickBooks Online.

- If you need to see detailed account activity for adjustments, the account form might be better.

- If you just need a general overview of balances for the worksheet, the report form is suitable.

QuickBooks Online likely provides guidance within the worksheet tool on which balance sheet format to use. It's recommended to check their specific instructions for the most accurate information.

## Q. a check that has full endorsement can be further endorsed by any bearer and therefore is not as safe as  a check with a blank endorsement? Answer True or False

False.

A check with a full endorsement is actually considered safer than a check with a blank endorsement. Here's why:

- Full Endorsement: Specifies the name of the payee (the person to whom the check should be paid). Only that person or their bank can further negotiate the check.

- Blank Endorsement: Only has the signature of the original payee. Anyone in possession of the check can write "Pay to the Order of" followed by their name and deposit or cash the check.

Safety Comparison:

- Full Endorsement: Restricts who can further negotiate the check, reducing the risk of unauthorized use if lost or stolen.

- Blank Endorsement: Allows anyone with the check to become the payee, increasing the risk of unauthorized negotiation.

Note:

- Once a check is cashed or deposited, even a fully endorsed check can no longer be further negotiated.

In conclusion, a full endorsement provides more security compared to a blank endorsement by limiting who can become the new payee of the check.

## Q. the wage bracket table method for determining federal income tax withholding may only be used for employees who are paid on either weekly or a monthly basis? True or False.

False.

- The wage bracket method for determining federal income tax withholding can be used for employees with various pay frequencies,  not just weekly or monthly.

The IRS allows the wage bracket method to be used for employees paid:

- Weekly, Bi-weekly, Semi-monthly, Monthly, Quarterly

As long as the appropriate table for the pay frequency is used and the employee's W-4 form information (filing status, allowances) aligns with the method, the wage bracket tables can be a valid way to withhold federal income tax.
