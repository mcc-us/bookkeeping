- Adjustments or adjusting entries are journal entries made to update acts for previously unrecorded items.     

- Adjustments recognize when expenses paid in advance, but have yet to be consumed. As time elapses, the asset is used. Because these expenses are bought before use, they are sometimes considered **assets**.  

1. Prepaid Expenses - { Insurance, Rent, Supplies, Advertising }  
1. Depreciation / Accumulated Depreciation   
1. Accrueed Expense-Interest   
1. Accrued Revenue   
1. Unearned Revenue

### Accrued Revenue

Accrued Revenue represents income a business has earned, but hasn't yet received payment for. 

For example:

- you complete a consulting project for a client and send them an invoice for $5,000. However, the client's payment terms are net 30, meaning they have 30 days to pay the invoice.

Accrued Revenue: In this scenario, you've earned the $5,000 fee for your consulting services completed on January 31st. However, you haven't received the payment yet because of the client's payment terms.

Accounting Treatment: To reflect the income earned in your financial statements for January, you need to record accrued revenue. This involves:

Journal Entry: Make a journal entry that:
- Debits an asset account (e.g., Accounts Receivable) for the amount earned ($5,000).
- Credits a revenue account (e.g., Consulting Revenue) for the same amount.

### Five common types of adjustments can vary depending on the business. 

1. *Depreciation Expenses*: This adjustment allocates the cost of an asset over its useful life as an expense. It ensures the asset's cost isn't recognized all at once but gradually spread over time. It benefits the business as the investment is being used.

1. *Accrued Expenses*: These adjustments recognize expenses incurred but not yet paid, resulting in a liability. 

1. *Accrued Revenues*: These adjustments recognize revenue earned but have yet to be recorded because cash has yet to be received. 

1. *Deferred Revenues*: These adjustments recognize cash received in advance for services you still need to provide. For example, suppose you receive a subscription payment in December for January access. In that case, you'd need to defer the revenue in December and record a deferred revenue liability.
