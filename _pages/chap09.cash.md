## Chapter 9 Cash Transactions

## Objectives

1. Cash account shortages or overages 

   - Cash register discrepancies should be recorded using the expense account `Cash Short or Over`.
  
2. Demonstrate a knowledge of procedures for a petty cash fund.

   - A petty cash voucher is prepared for each samll payment and signed by the person receiving the money. Usually, one person in charge of the fund records expenditures on a petty cash analysis sheet.

3. Demonstrate a knowledge of internal control routines for cash.

   - All businesses need a system of internal controls to protect cash from theft and mishandling and ensure accurate cash transaction records. A checking account is essential to store cash safely and make payments efficiently. For maximum control over outgoing cash, all payments should be made by check except those from carefully controlled special-purpose cash funds, such as petty cash funds. 

4. 'Write a check, endorse, prepare a bank deposit slip, and maintain a checkbook balance. 

   - Check writing requires careful attention to detail. If a standard checkbook is used, the stub should be completed before the check so that it will be remembered. The stub gives the data needed to journalize the payment.

5. Reconcile the monthly bank statement.

   - A bank statement should be immediately reconciled with the cash balance in the firm's financial records. Usually, differences are due to deposits in transit, outstanding checks, and bank service charges. Still, many factors can cause a lack of agreement between the bank balance and the book balance.

6. Record any adjusting entries required from the bank reconciliation.

   - Some differences between the bank balance and the book balance may require that the firm's records be adjusted after the bank statement is reconciled. Journal entries are recorded and then posted to correct the Cash account balance and the checkbook balance.

7. Understand how businesses use online banking to manage cash activities.

8. Many businesses now use online banking to receive and make cash payments.
