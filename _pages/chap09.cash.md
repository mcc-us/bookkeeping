**Replenishing Petty Cash Fund**

1. Total the columns on the petty cash analysis sheet.   
2. Total vouchers/receipts **+** cash on hand should **=** the amount of the fund, $(15.25 + 159.75 = 175.00)$.   
3. Write a check to replenish the petty cash fund at the end of each month or sooner if the fund is low. *See RED box above*.   
4. Prepare the journal entry to record the check.   


### 4. Internal Controls for Petty Cash  


1. One person is in charge of the `petty cash analysis/sheet` fund & expenditures.  This person has sole control, and is the only one authorized to make payments to/from the fund.   

2. Write petty cash fund checks to the person in charge of the fund, **NOT CASH.**   

3. Limit the petty cash amount to cover ~1 month.

4. Keep petty cash in a safe, a locked cash box, or a locked drawer.

5. Obtain a petty cash voucher for each payment. The voucher should be signed by the person who receives the money and should show the payment details. This provides an audit trail for the fund.

6. Use petty cash only for small payments where checks cannot be conveniently made.

7. Keep all receipts

### Cash Controls

Cash is most easily stolen, lost, or mishandled. It is important to protect all cash receipts to make sure that funds are available to pay expenses and other obligations. 

**The following are essential cash receipt controls:**

1. Have only designated employees receive and handle cash whether it consists of checks and money orders, or currency and coins. These employees should be carefully chosen for reliability and accuracy and should be carefully trained. In some businesses, employees who handle cash are bonded. Bonding is the process by which employees are investigated by an insurance company. Employees who pass the background check can be bonded; that is, the employer can purchase insurance on the employees. If the bonded employees steal or mishandle cash, the business is insured against the loss.

2. Keep cash receipts in a cash register, a locked cash drawer, or a safe.

3. Record all cash receipts in and out. For currency and coins, this record is the audit tape in a cash register or duplicate copies of numbered sales slips. The use of a cash register provides an especially effective means of control because the machine automatically produces a tape showing the amounts entered. This tape is locked inside the cash register until it is removed by a supervisor.

4. Before a bank deposit is made, check the funds to be deposited against the record made when the cash was received. The employee who checks the deposit is someone other than the one who receives or records the cash.

5. Deposit cash receipts in the bank promptly, *every day or several times a day*. Deposit the funds intact—do not make payments directly from the cash receipts. The person who makes the bank deposit is someone other than the one who receives and records the funds.

6. Enter cash receipts transactions in the accounting records promptly. The person who records cash receipts is not the one who receives or deposits the funds.

7. Have the monthly bank statement sent to and reconciled by someone other than the employees who handle, record, and deposit the funds
