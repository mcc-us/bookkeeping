**4 key components**

1. Opening balance
  
2. ADD: Net income & owner contributions 
   - Add net income, or the total profit after taxes and business expenses
   - Add owner contributions, capital invested during that period
   - This **represents the total assets**.
  
3. SUBTRACT: Net loss & withdrawals 
   - Subtract all losses for that period   
   - Subtract owner withdrawals  
   - This represents the company’s **total liabilities**. 
  
4. **Opening balance + Assets - Liabilities = Equity**
   -  Total retained earnings for that period.

### 3A. Trial Balances


**Purpose:**    
- Trial balances promote accuracy,   
- Identify potential issues,   
- Facilitate financial statement preparation,  
- Serve as an internal control.   
- More [Info](https://mcc-us.github.io/2024-01-29-trial-bal-v-bal-sheet.html)

**4 Steps**

1. Enter the general ledger account names.   
   - Assets followed by Liabilities, Capital, Drawings, Revenue, and Expenses

2. Enter the ending balance of each account in Debit or Credit column, using *Normal Balance*.   

3. Determine IF trial balance is in balance by totaling the Debit and Credit columns.   

4. Double underscore Trial Balance columns to show that the work in that column is complete.   

**NOTE: Trial Balance adds 4 accounts**:  
1. Accumulated Depreciation—Equipment,  
2. Supplies Expense,  
3. Rent Expense,  
4. Depreciation Expense—Equipment.

### 3C. Rules for Presenting Balances


1. Balance sheet assets are arranged on the bases of liquidity. 
   - Cash first
   - marketable securities,  
   - accounts receivable,  
   - supplies,  
   - inventory,  
   - prepaid items   
   - fixed assets (which appear in the order of longevity)     

2. Liability accounts appear based on their earliest due date.   
   -  A/P  
   -  bank notes payable
   -  mortgages payable   

3. Income statement accounts, both revenues and expenses appear in alphabetical order.   


**Key benefits it offers:**

1. **Verifies Accuracy**: The purpose of a Trial-Balance is to check for mathematical errors. By ensuring the total debits equal the total credits, you gain confidence that transactions are recorded correctly. This saves time compared to manually rechecking every entry.

2. **Identifies Potential Issues**: While a balanced Trial-Balance doesn't guarantee error-free accounts, it can uncover inconsistencies and missing entries. If the totals don't match, it indicates an error, prompting further investigation.

3. **Provides Overview of Financial Position**: The Trial-Balance offers a snapshot of the `financial position` at a specific point in time. Seeing total assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses one gains a high-level understanding.

4. **Aids in Financial Statement Preparation**: The Trial-Balance forms the foundation for preparing financial statements such as the balance sheet and income statement. By having all the balances readily available, you can easily transfer them to the appropriate statements, saving time and ensuring consistency.

5. **Internal Control Tool**: Regularly preparing Trial-Balance serves as a form of internal control. It promotes discipline and accuracy in daily bookkeeping and helps prevent errors and fraud from going undetected.

6. **Communication Tool**: The Trial-Balance can be used as a communication tool for stakeholders like managers, investors, or auditors. It provides a concise overview of the company's financial standing, facilitating discussions and decision-making.


### 4. Statement of Cash Flows


Statement of cash flows is a statement that lists the cash inflows and outflows for the business for a period of time.


### 5. Income Statements Vs Cash Flow Statements


**In essence**:

- The income statement shows how much money a company earned (profitability).
- The statement of cash flow shows how much money a company has on hand (liquidity).


The income statement and statement of cash flow are both important financial statements, but they provide different information:

See: [Describe-the-income-statement-statement-of-owners-equity-balance-sheet-and-statement-of-cash-flows-and-how-they-interrelate](https://openstax.org/books/principles-financial-accounting/pages/2-1-describe-the-income-statement-statement-of-owners-equity-balance-sheet-and-statement-of-cash-flows-and-how-they-interrelate)

**Income Statement**:

- Focus: Measures a company's profitability over a specific period.
- Records: Revenue earned, expenses incurred, and resulting net income (profit) or loss.
- Basis: **Uses the accrual accounting method**, recognizing revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of cash flow.
- Example: A company might sell products on credit (revenue earned) but not receive payment yet. The income statement reflects the sale as revenue even though cash hasn't been received.

**Statement of Cash Flow**:

- Focus: Tracks the `cash in & out` of a business over a specific period.
- Records: Cash inflows from operating, investing, and financing activities, and cash outflows for the same categories.
- Basis: **Uses a cash basis approach**, focusing on actual cash receipts and disbursements.
- Example: In the previous scenario, the statement of cash flow wouldn't record the sale until the customer pays in cash.

**An analogy**:

- Income Statement: Think of it like a company's scorecard. It shows how many dollars (revenue) were acquired and number of dollars (expenses) were used up, resulting in the final net income.   

- Statement of Cash Flow: Imagine the cash register tape for the game. It details all the cash received from ticket sales (operating inflow) and cash spent on refreshments (operating outflow) during the game.
