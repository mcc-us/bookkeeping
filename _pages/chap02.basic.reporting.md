### 2. Statement of Equity


> **Equity** =   
> Capital, Common Shares, Income, Dividends, Retained Earnings (Net Income) & Withdrawls
{: .block-tip }

**Four key components**

1. Opening balance = value of all assets at the beginning of accounting period
  
2. ADD: Net income & owner contributions 
   - Add net income, or the total profit after taxes and business expenses
   - Add owner contributions, capital invested during that period
   - This **represents the total assets**.
  
3. SUBTRACT: Net loss & withdrawals 
   - Subtract all losses for that period   
   - Subtract owner withdrawals  
   - This represents the companyâ€™s **total liabilities**. 
  
4. **Opening balance + Assets - Liabilities = Equity**
   -  Total retained earnings for that period.


|Prepare a 'Statement of Equity' (WITH STOCKS)|
|:-|
|1. ADD: Capital + Common Shares at beginning of period|
|2. ADD: Retained Earning at beginning of period|
|3.  +/- Net Income/Loss|

|5. SUBTRACT: Dividends & Drawings (Owner Withdrawls)|
