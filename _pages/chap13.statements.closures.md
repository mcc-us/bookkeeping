## Interpreting Financial Statements

## Terms

*Classified financial statement* - A format where revenues and expenses on the income statement, and assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, are divided into groups of similar accounts and a subtotal is given for each group.

*Single-step income statement* - An income statement where only one computation is needed to determine the net income. (Total Revenue − Total Exp = Net Income/Loss)

*Multiple-step income statement* - An income statement where many/several subtotals are computed before the net income is calculated.

*Condensed income statement* - An income statement summarizing detailed income statement accounts into a few lines of information.

*Liquidity* - The ease with which an item can be converted into cash; the ability of a business to pay its debts when due.

*Plant and equipment* - Property that will be used in the business for longer than one year.

*Inventory Turnover Ratio* = $\large \frac{COGS}{Average~ Inventory}$ 

*Average Inventory* = $\large \frac{Begining~ +~ Ending~ Inventory}{2}$

*Average Accounts Receivable* = $\large \frac{Begining~ +~ Ending~ Accounts~ Receivable}{2}$

#### OPEX

- Includes all the costs associated with keeping the business running, from marketing and administration to research and maintaining equipment, **excluding** direct costs of production or providing the services you sell (reflected in COGS).

**Common examples of OPEX**:

1. **Selling Expenses**: Marketing, advertising, and selling your products or services, includes sales commissions, marketing materials, salaries for sales staff.
   
2. **General & Administrative Expenses (G&A)**: Ongoing costs required to run business, not directly tied to production. For example: rent, utilities, office supplies, salaries for administrative staff, accounting fees.

3. **Research & Development (R&D)**: Expenses related to R&D or services. Example: salaries for R&D, materials used in R&D, all patent fees.

4. **Depreciation & Amortization**: These are non-cash expenses that spread the cost of long-term assets (property, equipment) over their useful life.
