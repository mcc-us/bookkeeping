#### What is the difference between a balances sheet and a "Classified Balance sheet"?


1. Balance Sheet: This is a basic financial statement that summarizes a company's assets, liabilities, and equity. It lists each category (assets, liabilities, equity) with subtotals, but the details within each category might be limited.

2. Classified Balance Sheet: This is a more detailed version. It further categorizes each section (assets, liabilities, equity) into subcategories. This provides a clearer picture of the specific types of assets, liabilities, and equity.


Benefits of a Classified Balance Sheet:

- Provides a deeper understanding of a company's financial health by showing the deeper breakdown of assets, liabilities, and equity.
- Helps company's assess liquidity (ability to meet short-term obligations) by classifying current and non-current assets and liabilities.
- Offers insights into a company's short-term and long-term debt.
