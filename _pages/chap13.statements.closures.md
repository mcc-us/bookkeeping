### Reversing Entries

**Example** 

12/31/2023: You have determined that your company's employees have accrued $5,000 in wages payable to date. However, payday is not until next week(period).

First, let's take care of wages exp/payable;

> Dr Wages expense 5,000  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cr Wages payable 5,000   
{: .block-tip }  

12/31/2023: Close books: Since it is the END of the period(year) we need to close the books.

> Dr Income Summary 5,000   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cr Wages expense 5,000   
{: .block-tip }   

1/1/2024: Because the wages were incurred last period that should be on the books for when they were incurred.

> Dr Wage payable 5,000   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cr Wages expense 5,000   
{: .block-danger }   

NOTE: We re-constitute the wages expense that we had for the last period but on this periods books.

1/3/2024: Record wages and payday

> Dr Wage expense 5,000   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cr Cash 5,000   
{: .block-danger }

#### 8 Operating Expenses

Op. Exps :eight: = **Expenses incurred during sales + Gen. Administrative Exp**

- Rent, utils, lights, salaries and wages, equipment exp, are often called Warehouse exps.

#### OPEX

- Includes all the costs associated with keeping the business running, from marketing, administration, R&D, and maintaining equipment. 
- It **excludes** direct costs of production or providing the services you sell (that are reflected in COGS).

**Common examples of OPEX**:

1. **Selling Expenses**: Marketing, advertising, and selling your products or services, includes sales commissions, marketing materials, salaries for sales staff.
   
2. **General & Administrative Expenses (G&A)**: Ongoing costs required to run business, not directly tied to production. For example: rent, utilities, office supplies, salaries for administrative staff, accounting fees.

3. **Research & Development (R&D)**: Expenses related to R&D or services. Example: salaries for R&D, materials used in R&D, all patent fees.

4. **Depreciation & Amortization**: These are non-cash expenses that spread the cost of long-term assets (property, equipment) over their useful life.
