- Adjustments or adjusting entries are journal entries made to update acts for previously unrecorded items.     

- Adjustments recognize when expenses paid in advance, but have yet to be consumed. As time elapses, the asset is used. Because these expenses are bought before use, they are sometimes considered **assets**.  

1. Prepaid Expenses - { *Insurance, Rent, Supplies, Advertising* }  
2. Depreciation / Accumulated Depreciation   
3. Accrueed Expense-Interest   
4. Accrued Revenue   
5. Deferred Revenue

### 4. Accrued Revenue

Accrued Revenue represents income earned, but hasn't yet received payment for. 

*Accrued Revenue*: you've earned the $5,000 for your consulting services. However, you haven't received the payment yet because of the client's payment terms.

*Accounting Treatment*: To reflect the income earned in your financial statements for January, you need to record accrued revenue. This involves:

**Example 4 Journal Entry**:
- Debit asset account (e.g., Accounts Receivable)   
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit revenue account (e.g., Consulting Revenue)


### 5. Deferred Revenue   

- *Debit* Deferred revenue account
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Credit* Account revenue

Scenario: You operate a magazine subscription service. On December 1st, a customer purchases a one-year subscription for $48. However, the subscription doesn't start until the January 1st.

Unearned Revenue: In this scenario, you receive $48 from the customer in December. However, you haven't "earned" the full revenue yet because you haven't provided all 12 issues of the magazine.

Accounting Treatment: On December 1st, you would record the $48 as unearned revenue. This account represents a liability, reflecting the money received but not yet earned.

As time passes, you gradually "earn" the revenue:

- January: When you mail the January issue, you would record \$4 (48 / 12 issues) as earned revenue (debiting an income account like "Magazine Subscriptions Revenue") and decrease unearned revenue by \$4 (crediting the unearned revenue account).
- February-December: You would repeat the process every month, recognizing \$4 in earned revenue and decreasing unearned revenue by \$4 until the full subscription period ends in December.


### Five common adjustments 

they can vary depending on the business. 

1. *Depreciation Expenses*: This adjustment allocates the cost of an asset over its useful life as an expense. It ensures the asset's cost isn't recognized all at once but gradually spread over time. It benefits the business as the investment is being used.

1. *Accrued Expenses*: These adjustments recognize expenses incurred but not yet paid, resulting in a liability. 

1. *Accrued Revenues*: These adjustments recognize revenue earned but have yet to be recorded because cash has yet to be received. 

1. *Deferred Revenues*: These adjustments recognize cash received in advance for services you still need to provide. For example, suppose you receive a subscription payment in December for January access. In that case, you'd need to defer the revenue in December and record a deferred revenue liability.
