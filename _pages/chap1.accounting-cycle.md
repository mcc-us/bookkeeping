*If this is your first time encountering this, use this list as a roadmap, because it is only an outline.*

## 1. Identify & Analyze Transactions

- Identify which accounts are impacted by the transaction. What are the account names & numbers?
- What accounts are increasing or decreasing? What accounts are the source of funds and what are the destination of the funds?
- Include date(s), notes for purchases, sales, payments, receipts, etc.

## 2. Record Transactions To Journal

- Entries should have three lines: debit, credit and description lines.

## 3. Post Transactions From Journal To Ledger

- Transactions listed in the Journal are transfered to their respective Ledger accounts.
- Each account has its own ledger for tracking.

## 4. Prepare Worksheet / Trial Balance(s)

- The accounting equation is not highlighted at this point.
- Instead, the Trial Balance lists all accounts in the journal/ledger with their *Normal Balances*, gerneally Assets, followed by Liabilities, Revenue, and Expenses.

## 5. Make Adjusting Entries (If Needed)

- Adjustments are made for unrecorded expenses, accrued revenues, prepaid expenses, depreciation, etc., bringing the account balances closer to their actual economic value.
- Mistaken entries are also dealt with at this time.

## 6. Complete Adjusted Trial Balance, Income Statement & Balance Sheet

- After incorporating adjustments, a new trial balance is generated,
- This reflects a more accurate picture of the company's financial state at a specific point in time.

## 7. Close the Books (If Needed)

**Journalize & Post Closing Entries**

Closing entries transfer the results of operating costs and net gain/loss to the *'Income Summary'* account then to the owner’s equity account (capital).
- Closing reduces the revenue and expense accounts to zero. So they are reset for the next period.   

**4 Steps**      

1. Transfer **All Revenue (Cr)** accounts to **Income Summary (Dr)**.  
2. Transfer **All Expense (Dr)** accounts to **Income Summary (Cr)**.  
3. Transfer **Income Summary (Net Gain or Loss)** to **Owner’s Capital (Cr)**.  
4. Transfer **Drawing (Dr)** account to **Owner’s Capital (Cr)**.  


- After the closing entries have been posted, the capital account reflects the Net Gain or Loss of operations for that period. 

- The revenue and expense accounts, with zero balances, are ready to accumulate data for the next period.
  
## 8. Prepare (Official) Financial Statements

1. Trial Balance
2. Income Statement
3. Statement of Equity
4. Balance Sheet

## 9. Interpret & Archive Records

- All transaction details, journal entries, & supporting documents are securely stored for future reference & potential audits.
