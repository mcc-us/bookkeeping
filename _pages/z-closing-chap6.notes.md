### 6-1 Journalize & Post Closing Entries.

Journalizing & posting the closing entries is the seventh step in the accounting cycle. Closing entries transfer the results of operations to owner’s equity and reduce the balances of the revenue and expense accounts to zero. The worksheet provides the data necessary for the closing entries. A temporary owner's equity account, Income Summary, is used. 

**There are four steps in the closing process**:

#### 1. The *Revenue* account is *transferred* to the *Income Summary*.

- Debit Revenue

- Credit Income Summary

#### 2. *All Expense* accounts are *transferred* to the *Income Summary*.

- Debit Income Summary

- Credit Expenses

#### 3. The *Income Summary* account is *transferred* to the *Owner’s Capital*.

If {NET LOSS or Income Summary has a credit balance}:

- Debit Income Summary

- Credit Owner’s Capital

If {NET INCOME or Income Summary has a debit balance}:

- Debit Owner's Capital

- Credit Income Summary

#### 4. The *Drawing* account is closed to *Owner’s Capital*.

- Debit Owner’s Capital

- Credit Drawing

- After the closing entries have been posted, the capital account reflects the Net Gain or Loss of operations for that period. 

- The revenue and expense accounts, with zero balances, are ready to accumulate data for the next period.

### 6-2 Prepare The Postclosing Trial Balance.

Preparing the postclosing trial balance is the eighth step in the accounting cycle. A postclosing trial balance is prepared to test the equality of total debit and credit balances in the general ledger after the adjusting and closing entries have been recorded. This report lists only permanent accounts open at the end of the period—asset, liability, and the owner’s capital accounts. The temporary accounts—revenue, expenses, drawing, and Income Summary—apply only to one accounting period and do not appear on the postclosing trial balance.

### 6-3 Interpret Financial Statements.

The ninth step in the accounting cycle is interpreting the financial statements. Business decisions must be based on accurate and timely financial information.
