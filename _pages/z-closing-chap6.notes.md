### 6-1 Journalize & Post Closing Entries.

Journalizing & posting the closing entries is the seventh step in the accounting cycle. Closing entries transfer the results of operations to owner’s equity and reduce the balances of the revenue and expense accounts to zero. The worksheet provides the data necessary for the closing entries. A temporary owner's equity account, Income Summary, is used. 

**Four steps in the closing process**:


Overview:   
1. Revenue & Expenses to Income Summary,   
2. Income Summary & Drawings to Capital  
- Closing may occur monthly, quarterly or yearly.

- 4 Steps   
    1. Transfer **All Revenue (Credit Side)** accounts **Income Summary (Debit Side)** account.  
    2. Transfer **All Expense (Debit Side)** accounts **Income Summary (Credit Side)** account.  
    3. Transfer **Income Summary (Net Gain or Loss)** account to the **Owner’s Capital (Credit Side)**.  
    4. Transfer **Drawing (Debit Side)** account to **Owner’s Capital (Credit Side)** account.  

- After the closing entries have been posted, the capital account reflects the Net Gain or Loss of operations for that period. 

- The revenue and expense accounts, with zero balances, are ready to accumulate data for the next period.

### 6-2 Prepare The Postclosing Trial Balance.

Preparing the postclosing trial balance is the eighth step in the accounting cycle. A postclosing trial balance is prepared to test the equality of total debit and credit balances in the general ledger after the adjusting and closing entries have been recorded. This report lists only permanent accounts open at the end of the period—asset, liability, and the owner’s capital accounts. The temporary accounts—revenue, expenses, drawing, and Income Summary—apply only to one accounting period and do not appear on the postclosing trial balance.

### 6-3 Interpret Financial Statements.

The ninth step in the accounting cycle is interpreting the financial statements. Business decisions must be based on accurate and timely financial information.
