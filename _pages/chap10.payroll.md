10 Payroll Computations, Records and Payment   

**How To**

1. Explain significant Federal laws relating to employee earnings and withholding. Several federal laws affect payroll:

- The Federal Wage and Hour Law limits the number of hours per week a non-exempt employee can work at the regular pay rate, to 40 hours. Greater than 40 hours per week, an employer involved in interstate commerce must pay one and one-half times the regular rate.

- Federal laws require that the employer withhold at least three taxes from the employee's pay: 
  1. the employee's share of social security tax, 
  2. the employee's share of Medicare tax, and 
  3. federal income tax. 

- Instructions for computing these taxes are provided by the government.

- If required, state disability and other income taxes can also be deducted. 

- Other deductions may include court orders for various items.

- Voluntary deductions can also be made.

2. Compute gross earnings - To compute gross earnings for an employee, it is necessary to know whether the employee is paid using an hourly rate basis, a salary basis, a commission basis, or a piece-rate basis.

3. Determine employee deductions for social security tax - Social security tax is levied equally on both the employer and the employee. It is a percentage of the employee's gross wages up to a maximum wage base limit during a calendar year.

4. Determine employee deductions for Medicare tax - The Medicare tax is levied equally on both the employer and the employee. There is no wage base limit for Medicare taxes. Under the Affordable Care Act, higher-income wage earners are now subject to an additional Medicare tax of 0.9 percent and the regular Medicare tax of 1.45 percent. Unlike the regular Medicare tax, this extra tax on high-income wage earners is paid only by the individuals: The business does not match the amount.

5. Understand employee deductions for income tax - Income taxes are deducted from an employee's paycheck by the employer and then paid to the government periodically. The employee's W-4, Publication 15, Circular E, and other IRS guidance are used to determine the amount of federal income tax to withhold.

6. Enter gross earnings, deductions, and net pay in the payroll register - Daily records of the hours worked by each non-supervisory employees are kept. Using these hourly time sheets, the payroll clerk computes the employees' earnings. Deductions and net pay for each payroll period and records the data in a payroll register.

7. Journalize payroll transactions in the general journal - The payroll register prepares a general journal entry to record payroll expenses and liability amounts. A separate journal entry records payments to employees.

8. Maintain an earnings record for each employee - At the beginning of each year, the employer sets up an individual earnings record for each employee. The amounts in the payroll register are posted to the individual earnings records throughout the year so that the firm has detailed payroll information for each employee. At the end of the year, employers provide reports that show gross earnings and total deductions to each employee.

Federal laws require that detailed payroll records be maintained for all categories of employees. The employer must keep a record of:

1. employee's name, 
2. address, 
3. Social Security number
4. date of birth;
5. hours worked each day and week, 
6. wages paid at the regular
7. overtime rates (certain exceptions exist for employees who earn salaries);
8. cumulative wages paid throughout the year;
9. amount of income tax, 
10. social security tax, and 
11. Medicare tax withheld for each pay period:
12. Proof that the employee is a U.S. citizen or has a valid work permit;
13. Cost of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage if provided by the employer.
