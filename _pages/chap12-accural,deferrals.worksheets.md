### Comprehensive Self Review

1. Why is the accrual basis of accounting usually preferred?  
   - Accrual basis accounting is preferred because it provides a more accurate picture of a company's financials. 
   - It recognizes revenue when it's earned and expenses when they're incurred, regardless of cash flow. 
   - It allows for better matching of revenue and expenses in the period they relate to.
   - It enables a better understanding of a company's obligations and accounts receivable.

2. How, does “accrued income” differ from “unearned income”?
   - Accrued income is money earned but not yet received, like services rendered on credit. 
   - Unearned income is money received but not yet earned, like advance payment for a future service. 
   - Both affect your financial statements, but at different stages of the transaction cycle.

Prepaid assets and both accrued income and unearned income involve payments made in advance, but for different reasons:

    Prepaid Assets: These are payments made for goods or services yet to be received.  For example, prepaying rent creates a prepaid asset account as you've paid for future occupancy.

    Accrued Income: This represents income earned but not yet received. It's the opposite of a prepaid asset. You've provided a service (like consulting) on credit, but the customer hasn't paid yet. The income is accrued (earned) but not yet reflected in your cash flow.

    Unearned Income: This is a liability created when you receive payment in advance for a service not yet performed.  Imagine receiving a payment for a magazine subscription that starts next month. You have a liability (unearned income) until you deliver the service (magazines) over time.
