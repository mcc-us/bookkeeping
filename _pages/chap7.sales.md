1. for cash, 
2. on account, and 
3. to customers paying with credit cards. 
4. Companies may also allow customers to return products for credit or for a cash refund. 

These transactions are recorded in the general journal. 

- For transactions including sales tax, the sales tax liability is recorded at the time of the sale: 
   - this ensures company records reflect the appropriate amount of sales tax liability.

### 7.2 Compute trade discounts

- Wholesale businesses often offer goods to trade customers at less than retail prices. 
- Trade discounts are expressed as a percentage off the list price. 
   - Multiply the list price by the percentage trade discount offered to compute the dollar amount.
   - The sale is recorded after deducting the trade discount.

- The accounts of individual credit customers are kept in a subsidiary ledger called the **Accounts Receivable Ledger**. Daily postings are made to this ledger from the general journal. â€˜The balance of each customer's account is computed after eash posting so that the amount owed is known at all times.

### 7.5 Prepare a schedule of accounts receivable.

- Each month a **schedule of accounts receivable** is prepared. It is used to prove the **subsidiary ledger** totals match the **Accounts Receivable** account in the general ledger.

### 7.6 Record the payment of sales taxes.

- Every business that collects sales taxes from its customers is responsible for accurately reporting and paying the amount of sales taxes collected to the appropriate government agency.
