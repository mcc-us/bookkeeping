#### A. Straight line depreciation

As found in [straight line depreciation - youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iruD9KTNnNc)

3 Steps

**Depreciation** is the act of reducing the book value of a fixed asset due to 'wear, tear and obselence'.

> **Example**: Your company buys a $50k truck. How much is depreciation?

#### A. 1. Write down known info

| Straight Line Depreciation Example |  |
|:-----------------------------------|-:|
| Asset name/description | truck |
| Depreciation method | linear depreciation |
| Asset initial cost | $50,000 |
| Residual (salvage) value | 10,000 |
| Useful life | 5 yr |
| Depreciation Rate | 1/5 = 20% per yr |



#### A. 2. Calculate the Depreciation Expense/Period

- Annual depreciation expense:

= (initial - final cost) / (usefullness in years) = ($50k - $10k)(5 yr) = $8k/yr

| Straight Line Depreciation Example ||
|---:|-----:|
| Depreciation rate / year = 1/5 | 20% |
| Depreciable cost / year | $8,000 |


#### A. 3. Build Depreciation Schedule/Table

| Year | Opening Value | Depreciation Expense | Accumulated Depreciation | Closing Value |
|---:|--------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|
| 1  | $50,000 | $8,000 | $8,000 | $42,000 |
| 2  |  42,000 |  8,000 | 16,000 |  34,000 |
| 3  |  34,000 |  8,000 | 24,000 |  26,000 |
| 4  |  26,000 |  8,000 | 32,000 |  18,000 |
| 5  |  18,000 |  8,000 | 40,000 |  10,000 |


#### B. Double declining depreciation

**3 steps**

DDB = (2 / Useful Life) x Book Value at Beginning of Period

Key components:

- *2*: Slope is twice of linear depreciation rate.
- *Useful Life*: The estimated number of years an asset will be used.
- *Book Value*: Value at purchase

> **Example**: Your company buys a $50k truck. How much is depreciation?

#### B. 1. Write down your known info

| Double-Declining Depreciation Example ||
| :--- |-----: |
| Asset name/description | truck |
| Depreciation method | double-declining depreciation   |
| Asset initial cost | 50,000 |
| Residual (salvage) value | 10,000 |
| Useful life | 5 yr |


#### B. 2. Calculate the Depreciation Rate

DDB Depreciation Expense = (2 / Useful Life) x Book Value at Beginning of Period

| Straight Line Depreciation Example ||
|---:|-----:|
| 2 * Depreciation rate / year = 2/5 | 40% |



#### B. 3. Build Depreciation Schedule/Table

| Year | Opening Value | Depreciation Expense | Accumulated Depreciation | Closing Value |
|---:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| 1  | $50,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |
| 2  |  30,000 |  12,000 |  32,000 |  18,000 |
| 3  |  18,000 |   7,200 |  39,200 |  10,800 |
| 4  |  10,800 |   4,320 |  43,520 |   6,480 |
| 5  |   6,480 |   2,592 |  46,112 |   3,888 |

#### Notes:

- *Declining Book Value*: Each year's depreciation expense is calculated based on the asset's remaining book value at the beginning of that year, resulting in decreasing depreciation amounts over time.
- *Salvage Value*: If a salvage value is expected at the end of the asset's life, it's typically ignored in DDB calculations until the final year.
- *Switching to Straight Line*: In some cases, DDB depreciation might be switched to straight-line depreciation in later years to avoid depreciating the asset below its salvage value.


#### C. Non linear depreciation


**4 alternative depreciations**

Non-linear depreciation methods account for factors like usage, technological advancements, or obsolescence. 


#### C. 1. *Units-of-production*: Depreciation is based on the number of units the asset produces, resulting in higher depreciation during periods of high activity.

#### C. 2. *Sum-of-the-years digits*: Each year receives a decreasing depreciation fraction based on the remaining useful life, with higher weights assigned to earlier years.

#### C. 3. *Declining balance with variable rate*: The depreciation rate can be adjusted based on factors like expected usage or asset performance, providing more flexibility.

#### C. 4. *Modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS)*: Commonly used in tax accounting, this method assigns specific depreciation rates to different asset classes, reflecting their expected decline in value.

Choosing the appropriate non-linear depreciation method depends on the specific nature of the asset, its usage patterns, and the desired level of accuracy.


#### D. MORE depreciation


#### Q. Is depreciation ever calculated in months?

Typically it is calculated and reported on an annual basis, there are instances where it might be calculated in months:

#### D. 1. *Partial-Year Depreciation*: When an asset is purchased or sold within a fiscal year, depreciation needs to be prorated for the partial period it was operational. The calculation often involves dividing the annual depreciation amount by the number of months in the year and then taking the appropriate proportion based on the months the asset was used.

#### D. 2. *Internal Management Purposes*: Some companies might prefer to track depreciation on a monthly basis for internal control or management purposes. This can be helpful for evaluating asset performance, budgeting, and forecasting cash flow. However, these monthly figures would primarily serve as internal management information and wouldn't necessarily be reflected in external financial statements.

#### D. 3. *Specific Depreciation Methods*: Certain non-linear depreciation methods, like Units-of-Production, base the depreciation on the asset's usage during a specific period, which could be monthly calculations.

Important things to remember:

- Even if depreciation is calculated in months, the annual depreciation amount remains the same. Months are mainly used for prorating or tracking purposes. For tax purposes, depreciation is usually reported on an annual basis according to specific regulations.
