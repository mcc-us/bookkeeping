What is FUTA and SUTA?


FUTA and SUTA are taxes employers pay to support unemployment benefit programs for workers. 

1. Both FUTA & SUTA contribute to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.
1. FUTA is a federal tax that goes to a national pool for unemployment benefits. At the same time, SUTA is a state tax that stays within that state.

### FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act):

- Federal Level: Tax paid to the U.S. government.
- Funding: It helps fund unemployment benefits for all states.
- Tax Rate: The FUTA tax rate is currently 6.0%, with a credit that can reduce it to 0.6%. Businesses generally pay the first 0.6% on the first $7,000 of wages paid to each employee annually.
- Filing and Payment: FUTA taxes are typically filed and paid quarterly.

### SUTA (State Unemployment Tax Act):

- State Level: Tax paid to the individual state's unemployment insurance agency.
- Funding: SUTA taxes fund unemployment benefits within that specific state.
- Tax Rate: SUTA tax rates vary significantly by state, typically between 2% to 8%. Some states might also have an additional tax based on an employer's history of layoffs.
- Filing and Payment: SUTA taxes are typically filed and paid quarterly, but deadlines and procedures can vary by state.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:
