What is FUTA and SUTA?


FUTA and SUTA are both taxes that employers pay to support unemployment benefit programs for workers. However, they have some key differences:

### FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act):

- Federal Level: This is a federal tax paid to the U.S. government.
- Funding: It helps fund unemployment benefits for all states.
- Tax Rate: The FUTA tax rate is currently 6.0%, with a credit that can reduce it to 0.6%. Businesses generally pay the first 0.6% on the first $7,000 of wages paid to each employee per year.
- Filing and Payment: FUTA taxes are typically filed and paid quarterly.

### SUTA (State Unemployment Tax Act):

- State Level: This is a state tax paid to the individual state's unemployment insurance agency.
- Funding: SUTA taxes are used to fund unemployment benefits within that specific state.
- Tax Rate: SUTA tax rates vary significantly by state, typically ranging from 2% to 8%. Some states might also have an additional tax based on an employer's history of layoffs.
- Filing and Payment: SUTA taxes are typically filed and paid quarterly, but deadlines and procedures can vary by state.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

|Feature|FUTA|SUTA|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Level|Federal|State|
|Funding|National unemployment benefits|State unemployment benefits|
|Tax Rate|6.0% (with potential credit)|Varies by state (2% - 8%)|
|Filing & Payment|Typically quarterly|Typically quarterly (may vary by state)|

In short:

1. Both FUTA and SUTA contribute to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.
1. FUTA is a federal tax that goes to a national pool for unemployment benefits, while SUTA is a state tax that stays within that state.
1. Tax rates and filing procedures differ between FUTA and SUTA.
