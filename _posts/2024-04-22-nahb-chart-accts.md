The inventory turnover ratio is classified as an activity ratio, not one of the categories you listed (liquidity, solvency, financial leverage).

Here's why:

- Liquidity ratios: Measure a company's ability to pay off short-term debts (within a year) with its current assets. Inventory turnover ratio doesn't directly address short-term debt payment.
- Solvency ratios: Assess a company's ability to meet its long-term financial obligations. Inventory turnover ratio doesn't focus on long-term solvency.
- Financial leverage ratios: Measure how much a company finances its operations with debt. Inventory turnover ratio isn't concerned with debt levels.

Activity ratios:

- Focus on how efficiently a company uses its resources, including inventory.
- The inventory turnover ratio specifically measures how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory over a period.
- A higher ratio indicates faster inventory movement and potentially better efficiency in managing inventory levels.
