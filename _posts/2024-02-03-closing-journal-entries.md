## Flowchart:   

Closing accounts & entries transfer temporary account balances, like revenue and expenses, into permanent accounts like retained earnings, resetting temporary accounts to zero and preparing them for the next period.

This crucial step ensures clear separation of current performance from past results, providing accurate and complete financial statements at the end of each accounting period.


### 1. Identify Temporary Accounts:

- Temporary Accounts are closed to **zero** at the end of a period, e.g. revenue, expenses, cost of goods sold.   
- Temporary Accounts are only used during an accounting period to summarize income and expenses.    

**NOTE: Permanent accounts track ongoing balances and are not closed, e.g. assets, liabilities, equity**.

### 2. Prepare Closing Entries (If Needed):

For each temporary account:
- ??????Create a closing entry to transfer its balance to a closing account (often "Income Summary" or "Profit and Loss Summary").   
- Debit the temporary account to zero out its balance.   
- Credit the closing account with the amount being transferred.   
- This step ensures temporary accounts start the new period with zero balances.   

### 3. Post Closing Entries:

- Update the individual account balances in the ledger with the closing entry amounts.   

### 4. Prepare an Adjusted Trial Balance:

- List all accounts and their balances after posting closing entries.  
- This ensures total debits still equal total credits, even after closing adjustments.   

### 5. Close the Closing Account (If Needed):

Depending on your system:
- Create a final entry to transfer the closing account balance (net income/loss) to the retained earnings account.   
- Debit the closing account to zero it out.  
- Credit the retained earnings account with the net income/loss.    
- This updates retained earnings to reflect the period's performance.   

### 6. Review and Analyze Statements:

- Prepare and analyze financial statements like the balance sheet and income statement using the final account balances.   
- Ensure they accurately reflect the company's financial position and performance.  

### 7. Re-Open Temporary Accounts (Optional):  

- After statement analysis, reverse the closing entries made earlier for temporary accounts.   
- Debit the closing account and credit the individual temporary accounts with the same amounts originally transferred.   
- This resets temporary accounts to zero, preparing them for recording transactions in the new period.   

### 8. Start New Accounting Period:

- Continue recording transactions in the journal and posting them to the ledger accounts.
- The cycle repeats from here for the next accounting period.   

### Notes:

- Closing entries are optional in some accounting systems and for businesses with continuous accounting periods.   
 - Check with your accountant or refer to relevant accounting standards for specific requirements and practices in your context.
