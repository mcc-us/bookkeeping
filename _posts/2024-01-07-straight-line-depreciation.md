**Depreciation** is the act of reducing the book value of a fixed asset due to 'wear, tear and obselence'.

**Example**: Your company buys a $50k truck. How much is depreciation?

#### 1. Write down known info

| Straight Line Depreciation Example |  |
|:-----------------------------------|-:|
| Asset name/description | truck |
| Depreciation method | linear depreciation |
| Asset initial cost | $50,000 |
| Residual (salvage) value | 10,000 |
| Useful life | 5 yr |
| Depreciation Rate | 1/5 = 20% per yr |

<br>

#### Step 2 - Calculate the Depreciation Expense/Period

- Annual depreciation expense:

= (initial - final cost) / (usefullness in years) = ($50k - $10k)(5 yr) = $8k/yr

| Straight Line Depreciation Example ||
|---:|-----:|
| Depreciation rate / year = 1/5 | 20% |
| Depreciable cost / year | $8,000 |

#### Step 3 - Build Depreciation Schedule/Table

| Year | Opening Value | Depreciation Expense | Accumulated Depreciation | Closing Value |
|---:|--------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|
| 1  | $50,000 | $8,000 | $8,000 | $42,000 |
| 2  |  42,000 |  8,000 | 16,000 |  34,000 |
| 3  |  34,000 |  8,000 | 24,000 |  26,000 |
| 4  |  26,000 |  8,000 | 32,000 |  18,000 |
| 5  |  18,000 |  8,000 | 40,000 |  10,000 |
