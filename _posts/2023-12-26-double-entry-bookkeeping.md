Double-entry accounting is a method used to track the categories: *Assets, Liabilities, Owner Equity, Revenue, Expenses*. "ALORE" are the main categories that transactions fall into.

Every transaction has two components:
- a debit side (on the left) and 
- a credit side (on the right)

| Account ||
|:--------|----------:|
| Debit   | Credit    |

In accounting, Debit and Credit ONLY refer to the left or right side of a T-table, journal or ledger.
In one sense, they do not hold any other meaning.

- Double-entry bookkeeping states that transaction may effect 2 or more accounts.  
- An **Account** is container/bucket that tracks specific assets, liabilities, equity, income, or expenses.
