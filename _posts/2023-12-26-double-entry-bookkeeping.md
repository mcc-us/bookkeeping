Double-entry accounting is a method used to track the categories: *Assets, Liabilities, Owner Equity, Revenue, Expenses*. "ALORE" are the main categories that transactions fall into.

Every transaction has two components, a debit side (on the left) and a credit side (on the right).

| Account ||
|:--------|----------:|
| Debit   | Credit    |

- Double-entry bookkeeping states that transaction may effect 2 or more accounts.  
- An **Account** is container/bucket that tracks specific assets, liabilities, equity, income, or expenses.

- **Using 'T-Accounts'**  

**Draw out T-accounts for each account in a transaction.**  

| Account ||
|:--------|----------:|
| Debit   | Credit    |

**Label the left side "Debit" and the right "Credit."**
- This can help you solidify the pairing as you see the impact on each account.  



**Assets increase with Debits, decrease with Credits**
  - Think of Debits as depositing money into the asset account, while a Credit is a withdrawl.

| Assets ||
|:--------|----------:|
| Debit + | Credit (-)|



**Liabilities increase with Credits, decrease with Debits** 

|| Liabilities |
|:----------|--------:|
| Debit (-) | Credit +|
