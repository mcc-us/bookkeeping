### 1. Sole Proprietor

- One owner is solely responsible for all debts and taxes.  
- Separate entity assumption - 'keep company and personal finances separate.  
- Business dies when owner does or when sold.  
- Easy to form: 'DBA'-Doing Business As  

### 2A. Partnerships

- Partners decide break down of all rights, obligations and limitations in the company beforehand.
     - $ or % initially contributed, % ownership, % or share of profits
     - Duties and responsibilities including to creditors and tax authorities OR Other intangible liabilities
- If one partner is negligent then other is **ON THE HOOK**
- Business is dissolved when the partnership is dissolved.

### 2B. Limited Liability Partnerships

- Partners are only responsible for their own actions.
- If one partner is negligent then other is **OFF THE HOOK**

### 3. Corporations

- Corp has legal right to own property and do business under its own name.
- Stock is used in place of simple owner's equity
- Private companies can be 'Closely Held' or private companies
- Stockholders are not responsible for the debts of the company.
- More complex overall to start and run

### 3B. S-Corps

- Has concept of **"pass-through taxation" and avoids double taxation**.
- Is treated like a partnership such that the corp pays no income tax.
- The advantage is that owner's have limited liability and avoid double taxation.
- Like any corp, the business has indeterminate life span

## LLC v. LLP

**Key differences between:**  
- Limited Liability Partnerships Vs. Limited Liability Company  

### Structure

- LLP: **Partners share profits and losses according to predefined agreements**. They are typically formed by professionals like lawyers, accountants, or doctors.   

- LLC: **Offers more flexibility, allowing for both partnership and corporate-like characteristics**. Members can choose to share profits and losses proportionally or based on specific agreements, similar to an LLP, or elect for fixed shares, like in a corporation.  

### Liability  

- LLP: **Partners can still be held liable for their own negligence or malpractice.** Partners have limited liability for the partnership's debts and obligations.  

- LLC: **Members enjoy limited liability for the LLC's debts and obligations, regardless of their individual actions** or negligence (except in rare cases of piercing the corporate veil).  

### Management and Governance

- LLP: **Typically managed by partners** who share decision-making responsibilities. Some states may require specific governance structures, such as managing partners.  

- LLC: **Can be managed by members, managers (appointed by members), or a combination**. LLC operating agreements outline management structure and decision-making processes.  

### Taxation

- LLP: Profits and losses pass through to partners' individual tax returns, **avoiding double taxation**. LLPs are treated as partnerships for tax purposes.  
- LLC: **LLC can elect corporate taxation status if desired**. Offering flexibility in choosing taxation. By default, LLCs are also taxed as partnerships.  This can be beneficial for larger LLCs or those with substantial profits.  

### Other Considerations

- Transferability of Ownership:  
  - **LLPs may have restrictions on transferring ownership interests**, while  
  - **LLCs generally offer more flexibility in transferring membership** interests.  

- Formation and Maintenance:  
  - LLPs may have specific formation and ongoing regulatory requirements depending on the profession or state.  
  - LLCs generally require less paperwork and ongoing formalities.
