## 1. Identify & Analyze Transactions

- Identify which accounts are impacted by transaction
- Include purchases, sales, payments, receipts, etc.

## 2. Record Transactions To Journal

## 4. Prepare Worksheet of Un/adjusted Trial Balance

- Trial balances do not concern themselves with ALORE.
- The accounting equation is not highlighted at this point, it simply shows all normal balances.
- Instead, the Trial balance lists all accounts in the journal/ledger with their *normal balances*.

## 5. Make Adjusting Entries (If Needed)

- For accuracy, adjustments are made for unrecorded expenses, accrued revenues, prepaid expenses, depreciation, etc., bringing the account balances closer to their actual economic value.

## 6. Prepare Adjusted Trial Balance

- After incorporating adjustments, a new trial balance is generated,
- This reflects a more accurate picture of the company's financial state at a specific point in time.

## 7. Close the Books (If Needed)

- This step is particularly relevant for periodic reporting (e.g., monthly, quarterly).  
- Closing involves transferring temporary account balances (revenue, expense) to permanent accounts (retained earnings), preparing them for a new reporting period.

## 8. Prepare Financial Statements

- Using the adjusted trial balance as a starting point, financial statements like the income statement, statement of equity and balance sheet are created.

## 9. Archive Records

- All transaction details, journal entries, & supporting documents are securely stored for future reference & potential audits.
