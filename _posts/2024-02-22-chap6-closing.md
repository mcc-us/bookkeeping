### 6-1 Journalize & post closing entries.

Closing entries is the **seventh step in the accounting cycle**. 

- Closing entries transfer **Revenue & Expenses** to **Owner’s equity** and reduce the revenue and expense accounts to zero. 
- The worksheet provides the data necessary for the closing entries.  Revenue comes from Fees Income, etc, and the Expenses are combined and transfered in one compound entry.
- A temporary owner's equity account, called the **Income Summary**, is used. 
- There are four steps in the closing process:

> #### R.E.I.D. = Revenue > Expenses > Income Summary > Drawings

- If Income Summary has a credit balance:

   - Debit Income Summary
   - Credit Owner’s Capital

- If Income Summary has a debit balance:

   - Debit Owner's Capital
   - Credit Income Summary

**4.** The **Drawing** account is closed to the **Owner’s Capital** account.

After the closing entries have been posted, the capital account reflects the results of operations for the period. The revenue and expense accounts, with zero balances, are ready to accumulate data for the next period.

### 6-2 Prepare a postclosing trial balance.

Preparing the post-closing trial balance is the **eighth step in the accounting cycle**. A postclosing trial balance is prepared to test the equality of total debit and credit balances in the general ledger after the adjusting and closing entries have been recorded. This report lists only permanent accounts open at the end of the period: *asset, liability, and the owner’s capital accounts*. The temporary accounts (*revenue, expenses, drawing, and Income Summary*) apply only to one accounting period and do not appear on the postclosing trial balance.

### 6-3 Interpret financial statements.

The **ninth step in the accounting cycle** is interpreting the financial statements. Business decisions must be based on accurate and timely financial information.

### 6-4 Review the steps in the accounting cycle.
