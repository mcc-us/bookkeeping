### 6-1 Journalize & post closing entries.

Closing entries is the **seventh step in the accounting cycle**.    

**1.** Transfer **All Revenue** accounts **Income Summary** account.   

**2.** Transfer **All Expense** accounts **Income Summary** account.   

**3.** Transfer **Income Summary** account to the **Owner’s Capital**.   

**4.** Transfer **Drawing** account to **Owner’s Capital** account.   

- There are four steps in the closing process:

> #### R.E.I.D. = Revenue + Expenses -> Income Summary + Drawings -> Capital

After the closing entries have been posted, the capital account reflects the results of operations for the period, EITHER A NET GAIN or LOSS.

The revenue and expense accounts (*with zero balances*) are ready to accumulate data for the next period.

### 6-2 Prepare a post-closing trial balance.

Post-closing trial balance is the **eighth step in the accounting cycle**. 

A post-closing trial balance is prepared to test the equality of total debit and credit balances in the general ledger after the adjusting and closing entries have been recorded. This report lists only permanent accounts open at the end of the period: *asset, liability, and the owner’s capital accounts*. The temporary accounts (*revenue, expenses, drawing, and Income Summary*) apply only to one accounting period and do not appear on the post-closing trial balance.
