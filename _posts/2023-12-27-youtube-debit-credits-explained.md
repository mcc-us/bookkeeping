![Cedit=Destination, Debit=Source](/assets/mc-graw-accounting-course/images/debit-destination-credit-source.png)

- **DEBITS** represent the flow of funds **To A Destination**

- **CREDITS** represent the flow of funds **From A Source**


*Fee-Income* or *Revenue* are recorded on right side, Credit accounts.
  
It's important to understand that debits and credits represent changes to specific accounts based on their economic nature (assets, liabilities, etc.).

**Remember:** ?????

Debits increase the "giving" sides (assets and expenses) and decrease the "taking" sides (liabilities, equity, and revenue).

Credits decrease the "giving" sides and increase the "taking" sides.
