![Cedit=Destination, Debit=Source](/assets/mc-graw-accounting-course/images/debit-destination-credit-source.png)

- **DEBITS** represent the flow of funds **To A Destination**

- **CREDITS** represent the flow of funds **From A Source**

It's important to understand that debits and credits represent changes to **specific accounts**, e.g. assets, liabilities, etc.

### Useful ??

Debits increase the "giving" sides (assets and expenses) and decrease the "taking" sides (liabilities, equity, and revenue).

Credits decrease the "giving" sides and increase the "taking" sides.
