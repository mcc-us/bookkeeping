The Going Concern Principle assumes that a company will continue operating into the foreseeable future unless there's substantial evidence to the contrary.

**Businesses that will be in it for the long haul will be stable into the future and retain a better value**

### Why is it a principle?

The **Going Concern** principle serves several purposes:

1. It provides a basis for valuation. For example, If a company goes out of business, its assets would be lower than ordinarily, i.e., **liquidation value**, or **fire sale**. Therefore, the Going Concern Principle allows valuing assets based on their expected future use, which is generally higher than their **liquidation value**.

1. It guides accounting practices: Knowing a company intends to continue operation **allows CPAs to use accrual accounting**. Whereby expenses or revenue are recognized when incurred, NOT when cash is exchanged. This reflects the ongoing economic activity better than just focusing on cash flows.

1. It enables financial statement interpretation: assuming continuity allows users to interpret financial statements (e.g., debt levels) realistically, understanding risks and opportunities associated with a continued operation.

### Importance of the Principle:

1. Accuracy: financial statements become more accurate and relevant when a business is stable.

1. Comparability: this allows comparisons of companies across industries and periods to be compared consistently.

1. Decision-making: Investors, creditors, and management use financial statements for informed decisions, and the Going Concern Principle helps stabilize future variability and risks.

### Derivation of the Principle:

The **Going Concern** principle isn't explicitly mentioned in historical accounting pronouncements but **emerged as a foundational assumption as it aligns with long-term sustainability and growth.**

### Important Caveats:

1. Not absolute: If evidence suggests imminent liquidation (e.g., bankruptcy filing), the going concern assumption loses validity, and specific accounting procedures differ.
1. Judgment involved: Determining the existence of "substantial evidence" against going concern requires professional judgment and analysis of various factors.

### Further Considerations:

1. The principle focuses on the foreseeable future, not indefinitely. What counts as "foreseeable" depends on industry norms and specific circumstances.
1. Different jurisdictions might have slight variations in interpreting and applying the Going Concern Principle.
