### Assumptions   

1. **Separate Entity** - Personal accounts must always be separated from business accounts.   
2. **Going Concern** - Business will continue to cover its obligations and debts, etc.  
3. **Monetary Unit** - Information is ONLY expressed in monetary terms.  
4. **Periodicity of Income** - Activities are separated into periods, e.g. monthly, quarterly, or yearly.  
5. **Objectivity** - Financial statements are based on verifiable data, free from personal bias.    
6. **Materiality** - Information that is significant enough to influence the decisions of users is disclosed.    
7. **Accrual Accounting** - Revenues & expenses are recognized when they are earned or incurred, regardless of cash flow.   
8. **Consistency** - Accounting methods are applied consistently within an entity and across periods.   
    

### Principles  

1. **Historical Cost basis** - Past amounts or market value determine values of assets or liabilities.   
2. **Revenue Recognition** - Revenue is recognized when it is earned (delivery of service or good) and realized (cost received).   
3. **Matching** - Revenue and Liabilities are matched to the 'period' they occurred.   
4. **Full Disclosure** - Full, relevant, honest and open monetary information.  
5. **Prudence** - Uncertainties are recognized in a conservative manner to avoid overstating assets or income.    
6. **Comparability** - Financial statements are prepared and presented in a way that allows for comparison across companies and industries.

????? Substance over Form: The economic substance of a transaction takes precedence over its legal form.


### More GAAP

- GAAP is developed by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).  
- The **SEC requires publicly traded companies to comply with GAAP.** 
- GAAP recommends that publicly traded companies have their financial statements audited by independent auditors.   
  - Standards can be changed by petitioning FASB. It's more common for the FASB to initiate changes based on research, public input, and emerging issues.  
  - **Exposure draft** describes proposed changes, **discussion memorandum** followed by **Accounting standards Codification** implementation  
  - Auditors produce report on the operation and financial position of the business   
  - Audits should be:  
    - Timely, accurate and fair   
    - Assets and liabilities should be objectively determinable  


#### GAAP is crucial for several reasons:

1. Transparency and Consistency:

  - GAAP provides a standardized framework for companies to prepare their financial statements. This ensures that the information presented is transparent, meaning investors, creditors, and other stakeholders can understand and compare companies' financial performance fairly.

  - Consistency over time allows for meaningful trend analysis and performance assessments. It helps users track a company's progress and identify potential red flags if financial metrics suddenly deviate from past trends.

2. Trust and Confidence:

  - By complying with GAAP, companies adhere to established best practices and ethical guidelines. This fosters trust and confidence among investors, creditors, and other stakeholders in the accuracy and reliability of the financial information presented.

  - This trust encourages investment and business relationships, fostering a healthy and stable financial environment.

3. Market Efficiency:

  - Standardized financial reporting allows for efficient allocation of capital across the market. Investors can compare apples to apples when evaluating different companies, making informed investment decisions based on accurate and comparable financial data.

  - This efficiency helps ensure that capital flows to companies with the most potential for growth and profitability.

4. Reduced Information Asymmetry:

  - By following GAAP, companies disclose essential financial information in a standardized format. This reduces information asymmetry between management and investors, and stakeholders receive relevant details about the company's financial health without needing specialized accounting knowledge.

  - This promotes informed decision-making by various stakeholders and helps mitigate potential conflicts of interest.

5. Regulatory Compliance:

  - Publicly traded companies and certain other entities are legally required to comply with GAAP for reporting purposes. This ensures that these companies adhere to minimum standards for financial reporting, promoting transparency and accountability.
