1. Trial balances promote accuracy,   
2. Identify potential issues,   
3. Facilitate financial statement preparation,

## 5 Steps

2. Enter the ending balance of each account in Debit or Credit column.   

3. Total the Debit and Credit columns to determine IF trial balance is in balance.   

4. Net differences between debits & credits, and write in balance(s).  

5. Double underscore Trial Balance columns to show that the work in that column is complete.   

6. **NOTE: Trial Balance has 4 new accounts**:  
   1. Accumulated Depreciation—Equipment,  
   2. Supplies Expense,  
   3. Rent Expense,  
   4. Depreciation Expense—Equipment.

## Key benefits it offers:

1. Verifies Accuracy: The fundamental purpose of a trial balance is to check for mathematical errors in your accounting records. By ensuring the total debits equal the total credits, you gain confidence that the basic recording of transactions is correct. This saves time and effort compared to manually rechecking every entry.

2. Identifies Potential Issues: While a balanced trial balance doesn't guarantee error-free accounts, it can uncover inconsistencies and missing entries. If the totals don't match, it indicates an error somewhere in your system, prompting you to investigate and rectify the issue before proceeding further.

3. Provides Overview of Financial Position: The trial balance summarizes the balances of all your accounts, offering a snapshot of your financial position at a specific point in time. You can quickly see your total assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses, gaining a high-level understanding of your business's financial health.

4. Aids in Financial Statement Preparation: The trial balance forms the foundation for preparing financial statements such as the balance sheet and income statement. By having all the balances readily available, you can easily transfer them to the appropriate statements, saving time and ensuring consistency.

5. Internal Control Tool: Regularly preparing trial balances serves as a form of internal control. It promotes discipline and accuracy in daily bookkeeping and helps prevent errors and fraud from going undetected.

6. Communication Tool: The trial balance can be used as a communication tool for stakeholders like managers, investors, or auditors. It provides a concise overview of the company's financial standing, facilitating discussions and decision-making.
