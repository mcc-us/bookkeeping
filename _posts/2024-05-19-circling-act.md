title: Circling Accounts
---


a balance that is circled in the accounts payable ledger is:   
1. a credit balance   
2. a debit balance   
3. a negative balance   
4. a zero balance   

The circled balance in the accounts payable ledger is most likely a 2. debit balance.  

**Here's why**:  

- Accounts Payable: This account represents the money a company owes to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit. By convention, accounts payable accounts have debit balances.  

- Credit Purchases: When a company makes a credit purchase, the Accounts Payable account is increased on the debit side to reflect the amount owed.  

- Purpose of Circling: Highlighting a balance with a circle could indicate it's an outstanding amount that needs to be paid to the supplier.  

Other Options Explained:

- Credit Balance: A credit balance in accounts payable is uncommon and would typically indicate an error. If a company pays a supplier in advance, it wouldn't be reflected in accounts payable but might be recorded in a separate account.  

- Negative Balance: Accounts payable balances aren't typically negative. A negative balance might suggest an error or a situation where the company has overpaid a supplier.  

- Zero Balance: A zero balance in accounts payable simply means the company has no outstanding obligations to suppliers at that particular moment.
