When discussing financial statements, it is common to look at them using the terms:  

Revenues: The income generated from a company's core business activities of selling goods or services.

Expenses: The costs incurred by a company in the process of generating revenue.

Gains: Increases in a company's wealth from non-core business activities, such as selling assets at a profit. 
   - For example, if a coffee business buys land for a wharehouse then sells it for more than it is worth, this is a gain. The difference is that the business is not selling property but selling coffee. 

Losses: Decreases in a company's wealth from non-core business activities, such as selling assets at a loss.
