Pre-paid expenses are initially considered assets bc you derive benefit from that asset in the future.

Insurance and Rent and supplies can be examples of pre-paid expenses/assets.

Example: Car insurance was purchased on June 1st for $1,200 per year. After the insurance is bought the year-end adjustment must be made on 12/31.
