**Draw out T-accounts for each account in a transaction.**  

| Account ||
|:--------|----------:|
| Debit   | Credit    |

**Label the left side "Debit" and the right "Credit."**
- This can help you solidify the pairing as you see the impact on each account.  


**Assets increase with Debits, decrease with Credits**
  - Think of Debits as depositing money into the asset account, while a Credit is a withdrawl.

| Assets ||
|:--------|----------:|
| Debit + | Credit (-)|


**Liabilities increase with Credits, decrease with Debits** 

|| Liabilities |
|:----------|--------:|
| Debit (-) | Credit +|
