Example 1

Step 1: Draw out T-accounts for an account in a transaction.**  
Step 2: Label the left-hand side of the T "*Debit*" and the right side "*Credit*."

| Debit || Credit |
|:------|-|-------:|
| Assets |=| |
| Assets increase when placed on the Debit(left) side. || Assets decrease when placed on the Credit(right) side. |
|Debit(+)||Credit(-)|


|Account Name:Cash<br>Cash is an asset ||
|:--------|----------:|
| Debit + | Credit (-)|
| Cash||
|Therefore Debiting $100 increases the amount of cash you have. |Crediting cash, or placing values on the right side subtracts $100 from your account|
|100|(100)|


**Liabilities & Equities increase with Credits, decrease with Debits** 

|| Liabilities |
|:----------|--------:|
| Debit (-) | Credit +|
