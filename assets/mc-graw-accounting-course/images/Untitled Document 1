### Closing Entries Explained: Step-by-Step with "Whys"

1. Identify Temporary Accounts:

- These track performance for the period (revenue, expenses). They need to be zeroed out for the new period.
- Why? It keeps the temporary accounts clean and reflects only current period activity.

2. Prepare Closing Entries (Optional):

- Each temporary account gets a closing entry: debit to zero it out, credit a closing account (often "Income Summary").
- Why? It provides a clear record of transferring balances without manually editing each account.

3. Post Closing Entries:

- Update individual account balances with the closing entry amounts.
- Why? It ensures that all accounts, including the closing account, reflect the transferred balances.

4. Prepare an Adjusted Trial Balance:

- List all accounts and their updated balances after closing entries.
- Why? It ensures total debits still equal total credits, even after closing adjustments.

5. Close the Closing Account (Optional):

- Depending on your system, create an entry to transfer its balance (net income/loss) to retained earnings.
- Why? It Updates retained earnings to reflect the period's performance, completing the income statement cycle.

6. Review and Analyze Statements:

- Prepare and analyze financial statements using the final account balances.
- Why? It provides meaningful insights into the company's financial health and performance.

7. Re-Open Temporary Accounts (Optional):

- After analysis, reverse the closing entries made for temporary accounts.
- Why? It resets them to zero, preparing them to record transactions for the new period.

#### Why close and re-open accounts?

Closing and re-opening accounts is like resetting an odometer on a car. We clear the temporary "mileage" (performance) for the previous period but keep the overall "odometer reading" (retained earnings) intact. Closing accounts allows for clean performance tracking in each period while maintaining an ongoing record of overall company value.
